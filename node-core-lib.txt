#EXERCISES

>Why is the fs core module important for Node development?

The fs core allows access to the file system through code.


>What is the difference between sync and non-sync methods in the fs module?

'Sync' refers to syncronous or blocking. The code runs in sequential order.  Syncronous code must execute first and finish before moving forward to the next line of code.

'Non-sync' refers to asyncronous or non-blocking.  The code does not have to wait for the current line to execute before moving on to the next line.


>Why are modules used?

Modules are synonymous to libraries.  They are pieces of code (functions) that are imported into a file.  They can be simple or complex in functionality; they are organized in single or multiple files which can be reused throughout the node application.  


>Why are libraries such as fs used in Node programming?

They allow additional functionality for an application.  The `fs` core is used to provide an application a way to work with the computer's file system.  

E.g. 
`writeFile` allows a js file to that can write data into a file such as `input.txt`

`readFile` allows a file to be accessible and read such as a password file.

`rmDir` allows the removal of a directory

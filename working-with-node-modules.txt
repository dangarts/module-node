#EXERCISES

1. How do you import a module?

- Create a JS file containing code  which is encapsulated with `module.exports`  This makes properties and methods available outside of the module.
- In the main JS file(index.js), use the `require/import` function to import the module created in the first step



2. What Javascript statement do you use to export a module?

module.exports = {
  //methods go here 
};


#ONLINE RESEARCH QUESTIONS

1. Are there other ways to export a module?

- exports.method = function() {…} 
- module.exports.method = function() {…}


2. What are ES6 modules and how do they differ from the module we created in this checkpoint?

ES6 modules are also chunks of reusable JS code.  They are available for use when the the module file exports them. This leads to a 2 module system provided for developers:

1. require() from nodeJS
- dynamic loading of modules if it is truly required
- loading is syncronous

2. import from es6
- code is selectively loaded
- import is asyncronous (allows slightly better performance)
